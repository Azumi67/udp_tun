# udp_tun
This tool creates TUN interfaces on both client and server to tunnel IP packets over UDP. It offers optional XOR encryption, dynamic pacing, jitter buffering, keep-alives, reconnect logic, and multithreaded operation (with epoll). Use CLI options to fine-tune IP, MTU, buffers, logging, and more.
